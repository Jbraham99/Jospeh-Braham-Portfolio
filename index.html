          <h2>About Joseph</h2>
          <p>After starting my own audio engineering business, I found myself wanting to learn and grow as an individual with my skill. After doing more research I discovered that you can only go so far as an audio engineer. You can infinitly grow your business, but would always rely on new technologies to be produced to then apply old knowledge to those products.</p> <br />
          <p>Throughout my research, I kept stumbling upon software development. The idea of constantly learning new things and keeping up with new technologies was very appealing to me.</p> <br />
          <p>Currently, I've been learning how to fly airplanes and have been having a blast. If you are looking to hire someone that has a passion for creating, want to talk about music or airplanes I would love to chat.</p>
